This folder contains helper scripts.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📁 SCRIPTS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

generateGameLists.bat  - Manually generate game lists
                         (Usually not needed - start.bat does this)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💡 NOTE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You DON'T need to run these manually!

start.bat already includes game list generation, so just use that.

These scripts are only here if you want to:
- Run a manual server (python -m http.server)
- Regenerate lists without launching the app
- Understand how the scanning works
