🆘 HELP & SUPPORT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Common Issues:

Q: Nothing loads, just a spinning circle?
A: You MUST use start.bat, not open index.html directly.
   Install Python 3 if you don't have it.

Q: "Python is not installed"?
A: Download from https://www.python.org/downloads/
   Or use start-node.bat (requires Node.js from https://nodejs.org/)

Q: No games found?
A: Make sure ParrotOrganizer is INSIDE TeknoParrot folder:
   TeknoParrot/
   ├── TeknoParrotUi.exe
   └── ParrotOrganizer/  ← Here!
