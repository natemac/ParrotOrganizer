  <Description>2 Spicy (also known as Too Spicy) is a cover-based third-person shooter built around head‑to‑head gunfights. Players wield light guns while using two foot pedals to slide left or right between cover, perform jump shots and dodges, and hide behind pillars or oil drums. Aim at the screen to fire and away to duck into cover; holding your target triggers a zoom for more powerful headshots. The game features story and versus modes with multiple stages and encourages strategic use of the environment and timing to defeat opponents.</Description>
