╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

The files in this folder are automatically generated every time you
run start.bat.

📁 WHAT'S IN HERE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

gameProfiles.txt  - List of all available TeknoParrot games
                    (scanned from ../GameProfiles/*.xml)

userProfiles.txt  - List of games you have installed
                    (scanned from ../UserProfiles/*.xml)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚠️  DO NOT EDIT THESE FILES!
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Any changes you make will be overwritten the next time you launch
the app.

These files are regenerated automatically to ensure your game list
is always up-to-date with your TeknoParrot installation.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✨ HOW IT WORKS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Every time you run start.bat:
1. It scans the TeknoParrot folders
2. It finds all .xml game profile files
3. It creates these .txt list files
4. The app reads these lists to know what games exist

This happens automatically in seconds - you don't need to do anything!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Safe to delete? YES!

This entire folder will regenerate the next time you launch the app.
