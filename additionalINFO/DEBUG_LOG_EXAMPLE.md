## Summary of Information Logged

### System & Environment
- **Node.js version** - Which Node.js version the server is running
- **Operating System** - Windows version, architecture (x64/x86)
- **Hardware** - CPU count, total RAM
- **Browser** - User agent, screen resolution, window size
- **Paths** - All critical folder paths and working directories

### ParrotOrganizer Installation
- **Required files verified** - All operational files (HTML, JS, CSS, scripts) exist
- **Location verified** - Confirms ParrotOrganizer is inside TeknoParrot folder
- **TeknoParrotUi.exe found** - Confirms correct installation location
- **Storage folder** - Lists user-specific data files (preferences, custom profiles, debug logs)

### TeknoParrot Folder Structure
- **GameProfiles** - How many XML files found
- **UserProfiles** - How many installed games found
- **Metadata** - How many metadata JSON files found
- **Icons** - How many icon image files found

### Game Scanning Results
- **Total games scanned** - From gameProfiles.txt
- **Total games loaded successfully** - Actually processed by app
- **Installed games count** - From UserProfiles folder
- **Not installed games count** - Available but not installed
- **Failed to load count** - Games that had errors during loading
- **Sample game names** - First 5-10 games for verification

### Data File Breakdown
- **GameProfiles loaded** - How many game profile XMLs were parsed
- **UserProfiles loaded** - How many user profile XMLs were parsed
- **Metadata loaded** - How many metadata JSON files were loaded
- **GameSetup loaded** - How many game setup XMLs were loaded

### Performance Metrics
- **Total initialization time** - How long the entire startup took
- **Game loading duration** - How long just loading games took
- **Individual operation timings** - Each major step is timed

## How This Helps Diagnose Issues

### If a user reports "No games showing up":

1. **Check Server Logs** - Did GameProfiles folder scan succeed?
   - If `xmlFileCount: 0` ‚Üí GameProfiles folder is empty or missing
   - If folder path is wrong ‚Üí Installation location issue

2. **Check Game List Generation** - Did gameProfiles.txt get created?
   - If file missing ‚Üí start.bat didn't run correctly
   - If empty ‚Üí GameProfiles folder has no XML files

3. **Check Client Loading** - Did browser load the game list?
   - If `totalGamesScanned: 0` ‚Üí gameProfiles.txt is empty
   - If `failedToLoad: 156` ‚Üí Major compatibility issue

4. **Check Installation Verification** - Are all 8 checks passing?
   - If TeknoParrotUi.exe check fails ‚Üí Wrong installation location
   - If folders missing ‚Üí Incomplete installation

### If a user reports "Games not installing":

1. **Check UserProfiles count** - Is it increasing after install?
2. **Check server install logs** - Look for `/__install` endpoint errors
3. **Check folder permissions** - Can server write to UserProfiles folder?

### If performance is slow:

1. **Check total duration** - Is initialization taking too long?
2. **Check game count** - Is the user trying to load 1000+ games?
3. **Check metadata count** - Missing metadata can slow things down
4. **Check system specs** - Low RAM or CPU count?
